<h1>Intro to JS Scope</h1>

	<p>Scope is the <em>context</em> that code is executed in</p>

	<p>When we define something outside of a function, we still have access to it INSIDE a function. The opposite isn't true.</p>

	<p> var y = 10;
		function doMath(){
		 console.log(y);
		}

		doMath() returns 10

		BUT NOT THE OTHER WAY AROUND
	</p>

	<p>If a variable is DECLARED OUTSIDE the function is can be used inside of it, AND ITS VALUE WILL BE CHANGED if changed inside the function.</p>

		<p>var x = 10;

		function doMoreMath(){
			x = 12;
			console.log(x);
		}

		doMoreMath() will return 12</p>
	
	<p>However, if the same variable is DECLARED inside of the function, JavaScript will treat it as separate variables</p>

		<p>var z = 9;

		function doSomething(){
		var z = 10;
		console.log(z);
		}

		</p>

		<p>If we call z, it returns 9</p>
		<p>If we call the function doSomething(), it returns 10</p>

	 <p>Every function has its own scope and it isn't shared between functions</p>
