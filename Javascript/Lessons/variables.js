//Variables are simply containers that store values
//They follow this pattern:
var yourVariableName = yourValue;

//They can store all of the values we've seen
var name = "Rusty";
var secretNumber = 73;
var isAdorable = true;

//Recall the store value by calling the variable name
var name = "Rusty";
"Hello there " + name; //"Hello there Rusty"

var num = 37;
num + 3 + 10 //50

//We can also update existing variables
var name = "Robert";
name = "Bob";

//The two other primitives are null and undefined

//Variables that are declared but not intiialized are UNDEFINED
//The follwoing variables are undefined:
var name;
var age;

//null is "explicitly nothing"
var currentPlayer = "charlie";
currentPlayer = null; //game over
